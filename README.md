Introduction

This repository contains a Node.js backend server built with Express.js and MongoDB. It provides a comprehensive set of RESTful APIs for managing various resources such as users, products, and orders. The server is designed with scalability and maintainability in mind, making it suitable for production environments.


Features

•	RESTful API with CRUD operations
•	User authentication and authorization with JWT
•	Role-based access control
•	Validation and sanitization of inputs
•	Comprehensive logging and error handling
•	Unit and integration tests
•	Docker support for containerized deployment
•	Swagger documentation
•	Environment-specific configurations


Architecture

The application follows a modular structure with separation of concerns. Key components include:

•	Controllers: Handle incoming requests and return responses
•	Services: Contain business logic
•	Models: Define the data schema and interact with the database
•	Routes: Define the API endpoints and map them to controllers
•	Middlewares: Include authentication, authorization, logging, error handling, etc.


Requirements

•	Node.js (>=14.x)
•	npm (>=6.x)
•	MongoDB
•	Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)


Installation

1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

2.	Install the dependencies:

npm install


Configuration

1.	Create a .env file in the root directory of your project and add the following environment variables:

NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key

2.	Customize other configuration settings in the config directory as needed.

Running the Server

1.	Start the MongoDB server (if it's not already running):

mongod

2.	Start the Node.js server:

npm start

3.	The server should now be running at http://localhost:3000.


API Documentation

The API endpoints and their usage are documented using Swagger. To view the documentation, navigate to http://localhost:3000/api-docs in your browser.


Database

This project uses MongoDB as the primary database. Mongoose is used as an ORM to interact with MongoDB. The database schema is defined in the models directory.


Database Migrations

To manage database migrations, you can use the migrate-mongo package. Follow these steps to create and apply migrations:

1.	Install migrate-mongo:

npm install -g migrate-mongo

2.	Initialize migrate-mongo:

migrate-mongo init

3.	Create a new migration:

migrate-mongo create migration-name

4.	Apply migrations:

migrate-mongo up


Security

The application implements various security measures, including:
•	JWT-based authentication and authorization
•	Input validation and sanitization using express-validator
•	Secure HTTP headers using helmet
•	Rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks


Error Handling

Centralized error handling is implemented to ensure consistent error responses. Errors are captured and logged, and meaningful error messages are returned to the client. The errorMiddleware handles all errors and returns appropriate HTTP status codes.


Logging
Winston is used for logging. Logs are categorized into different levels (info, error, debug) and are written to both console and log files. Configuration for logging is available in the config directory.


Testing

1.	Run unit tests:

npm test

2.	Run integration tests:

npm run test:integration

3.	Run test coverage:

npm run coverage

Test cases are written using Jest and Supertest.


Deployment

To deploy the server, you can use Docker. Follow these steps:

1.	Build the Docker image:

docker build -t your-image-name .

2.	Run the Docker container:

docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env your-image-name


Deployment to Cloud Services

The application can be deployed to cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku. Ensure that environment variables are set correctly and use CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.
