Introduction
This repository contains a Node.js backend server built with Express.js. It provides a comprehensive set of RESTful APIs for managing various resources, such as users, products, and orders. The server is designed with scalability and maintainability in mind, making it suitable for production environments.

Features
RESTful API with CRUD operations
User authentication and authorization with JWT
Role-based access control
Validation and sanitization of inputs
Comprehensive logging and error handling
Unit and integration tests
Docker support for containerized deployment
Swagger documentation
Environment-specific configurations
Architecture
The application follows a modular structure with separation of concerns. Key components include:

Controllers: Handle incoming requests and return responses
Services: Contain business logic
Models: Define the data schema and interact with the database
Routes: Define the API endpoints and map them to controllers
Middlewares: Include authentication, authorization, logging, error handling, etc.
Requirements
Node.js (>=14.x)
npm (>=6.x)
MongoDB (or any other database you are using)
Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Configuration
Create a .env file in the root directory of your project and add the following environment variables:

env
Copy code
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
Customize other configuration settings in the config directory as needed.

Running the Server
Start the MongoDB server (if it's not already running):

bash
Copy code
mongod
Start the Node.js server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The server should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

API Documentation
The API endpoints and their usage are documented using Swagger. To view the documentation, navigate to http://localhost:3000/api-docs in your browser.

Database
This project uses MongoDB as the primary database. Mongoose is used as an ORM to interact with MongoDB. The database schema is defined in the models directory.

Database Migrations
To manage database migrations, you can use the migrate-mongo package. Follow these steps to create and apply migrations:

Install migrate-mongo:

bash
Copy code
npm install -g migrate-mongo
Initialize migrate-mongo:

bash
Copy code
migrate-mongo init
Create a new migration:

bash
Copy code
migrate-mongo create migration-name
Apply migrations:

bash
Copy code
migrate-mongo up
Security
The application implements various security measures, including:

JWT-based authentication and authorization
Input validation and sanitization using express-validator
Secure HTTP headers using helmet
Rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks
Error Handling
Centralized error handling is implemented to ensure consistent error responses. Errors are captured and logged, and meaningful error messages are returned to the client. The errorMiddleware handles all errors and returns appropriate HTTP status codes.

Logging
Winston is used for logging. Logs are categorized into different levels (info, error, debug) and are written to both console and log files. Configuration for logging is available in the config directory.

Testing
Run unit tests:

bash
Copy code
npm test
Run integration tests:

bash
Copy code
npm run test:integration
Run test coverage:

bash
Copy code
npm run coverage
Test cases are written using Jest and Supertest.

Deployment
To deploy the server, you can use Docker. Follow these steps:

Build the Docker image:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t your-image-name .
Run the Docker container:

bash
Copy code
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env your-image-name
Deployment to Cloud Services
The application can be deployed to cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku. Ensure that environment variables are set correctly and use CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.
